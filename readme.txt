Steps
	createdb.bat
		creates database
		
	then run 
		cleandatacode.r

	what it does is two loops.  One changes the seed each pass/iteration of cv over the sample.  The second pass is the base and it resamples from the population (not from a separate training partition, everything get's rescrambled, including holdout).  

	line 237
	#static (outside of monte carlo/resampling, if desire resampling, simply move above set.seed(base))
	line 266
	#monte carlo resample of non holdout!
	
	line 240: 
	NewDF.holdout
	Holdout is always same static regardless of monte carlo resample.
	
	Semiotic Grid construction (confusion Matrix)
		binary classifier terms
	
	Vars
		widthDivisor
			Sets
				% of sample size in terms of holdout as well as training/validation partitions
				
				Min of 1 seed width
				min of 1 CV width
				
				Default is 3, integer's from 2 to 5 are recommended.
				CV width
				CV passes
				# of models
				Width of loops
		
Hypothesis
		at the 5% sample level using the aggregate data of the subset of the holdout.  We will derive a regression equation there.  Then we will check it against the population and see if it was within range.  If so, we will confirm our hypothesis.  As an addendum, we can derive a population level... this part I think I'd like to ask the professor about.
		
		V7118profile <- c("V7118","V7202","V7551","V8502")   
		eventually reduced to ("V7118, "V7202") (after holdout analysis)

		so... I can derive a regression equation at the holdout analysis juncture, and then see if it holds when I derive a newdataset of the population and derive it's new coefficient terms fitting a model.  See if it's terms fit within the range predicted at the holdout analysis level.  At these junctures, the datasets are aggregated independently (different sampling due to inclusion of different factors, i.e. na drops records based on what columns are included)
		
		Feature extractor will extract features that should display in random samples as significant.
		
		StepAIC
		
		vs CV
		
		different things
		
		V8517 still resulting on 0...
	NA's
	Records
		182338 

		the pattern of similar na %'s has me wondering if some years are missing data... 
		I only check medians on certain factors...

	Milestone 1
		Identified relationships as of commit 3063ef8

	Milestone 2
		Cross validation
		Identified relationships using colsums over a subsample of entire database
		
	Milestone 3
		Implemented Cross Validation and stopped using stepAIC and opted for bestglm which allows for the smallest model to converge based on lowest cv error.  Bestglm has built in CV, which elinates the need for an external loop.
		By aggregating these terms from each subdomain up, we construct a terms list that we feed into a new bestglm formula which spits out a new list.  This list when applied to the population shows extermely significant on all terms.  We tried monte carlo with a manual CV loop but find the cross validation does all the work of comprehensively testing our sample.		

		
	Milestone 4
		Implemented cross validation, monte carlo resampling of sub sample, and resampling of holdout/non holdout data in 2 distinct loops.  I use a width factor that controls all the loops to include # of k folds and cv iterations.  Set to 2 atm.  Default will be 3.		
			
	Milestone 4.2 59eff5e
		
	Milestone 5
		Widthdiviser

	Milestone 6
		In correct formula's, but implementation of 4thpass.

			Exclude >1q
			Problem is... these are limited to 5 in the subset window, would be nice to modify the bestglm.r file to include all the subsets up to k and then filter by those colsums >=median or even >= 3q
			
			Exclude min of best subset on final bout after 3rd pass?

		Milestone 8
			using numRuns >= 50% as bar for inclusion of cv results
			Combing categories of single factors into their own group
			removed a resampling that was redundent ensuring proper holdout was being performed
			
			V7118 and dependent var V8565, in one model it's almost .05 significant, in another it's like .8.  difference being widthSize, perfect example of when a var is significant in one model but not another.  Most likely due to the info is already included in other vars and would be a prime candidate for PCA
				
			incorrect >= 50%...

	Milestone 8.1
	
	219e503
	
		Implemented correct >= 25% as V8517 would not hit this threshold (33% across 4 variables)
		
		Seed appendix for widthSize 1, 2, 3, 5
		
		note widthSize starts excluding at the 25% threshold and excludes the entire v7118 series!
		
		I think it's related to the the holdoutreset loop.  The patterns are being captured on a specific loop, or are present in that % of the population that is captured on that loop.  I'm not overly concerned other than to include it.
		
		reseed bug
		
	Mmilestone 8.2
		
	Milestone 9 90395b6
		
		data.train and data.test were not being utilized correctly.  Basically there was no filtering taking place at the second juncture.
		
	Milestone 9.1
		same algorithm, but with data.train and data.test doing na's during there needed times only.
		
		0b166be
		
	Milestone 10
		Implemented widthSize iterations as well as ability to filter by >= or > median

Percent formula  
	To get more dispersion, increase holdoutreset loop to say 100 and set resample loop max to 1.  This will be somewhat expensive but will force a reshuffle of the dataset each pass.  As is a CV of 10 simulates this effectively enough without being as expensive.
	
	Imagine the holdout is you shuffle the cards (~reseed & holdout sample) and then 
		take a set of cards away from a deck (macro: holdoutset & nonholdoutset)
		and resample is you take a subsample from this set (micro: pretrain=data.train & holdout=data.text)
		
		Due to this sampling, variations occur during 2a tablization within each holdoutSet's iteration
	
	The ^3 is for reseed, holdout reset, remonte carlo.
	
		Normally, one only needs to do one seed, therefore reducing to ^2	
		
	The +3x is for post evaluation and is used for evaluating the model and if the experiement holds (i.e. always significant population terms), then this part can be viewed as not counted towards the overall cost.
	
	Therefore widthDiviser of 5+ can be accomodated for.  With a max of 10, for ^2 with a 10x10 = 100%, which would result in 100 passes and would obviously monte carlo simulate 100%, but not quite converge.
	
  (x^3)+(3x)
  only the mc set is what costs anything (pre non holdout size) , not the resampling from this set (i.e. pretrain)
  
  the ^3 is the final pruning of the set of factors through a new double wide merged partition set
  then a subsequent one where a fit is derived to confirm significance
  then a 3rd where measures of accuracy are performed  

Cross validation means that if the patterns show up more than half the time (5 out of 10 passes), they are probably truly significant.  I usually have a higher bar, such as the top quartile, or top 10-20%.
	These are not just cross validated against training sets 10 times.  
	To report a positive number.  The significant factors found during the training partition are applied to the validation partition, and what remains as significant are reported.

In many cases, a single class is of special interest, so we will focus on that particular lcass and compare the propensity of belonging to that class to ac utoff value set by the analyst.... If hte probability of belonging to the lcass of interest is above the cutoff, the case is assigned to that class.

				Model Assumptions
				https://www.statisticssolutions.com/assumptions-of-logistic-regression/
				
				First, binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary and ordinal logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be ordinal.

				Second, logistic regression requires the observations to be independent of each other.  In other words, the observations should not come from repeated measurements or matched data.

				Third, logistic regression requires there to be little or no multicollinearity among the independent variables.  This means that the independent variables should not be too highly correlated with each other.

				Fourth, logistic regression assumes linearity of independent variables and log odds.  although this analysis does not require the dependent and independent variables to be related linearly, it requires that the independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.

				Finally, logistic regression typically requires a large sample size.  A general guideline is that you need at minimum of 10 cases with the least frequent outcome for each independent variable in your model. For example, if you have 5 independent variables and the expected probability of your least frequent outcome is .10, then you would need a minimum sample size of 500 (10*5 / .10).

			nested (anaysis of variance).
				Is variance reduced?
				nested compares rss
				nested model test for GLM's compares the values of an analogous quantity
					the residual deviance, for two nested models.
					The resulting test is then called an "Analysis of deviance test or sometimes called a "likelihood ratio" test.
					
					this is the chi-squared value using a df equal to the # of factors being removed.
					Derive residual deviance for each model
					
					All this is reported in R while outputting the glm model as "Residual deviance"

						"To find a percentile (critical value) for a chi-squared distribution, select Transform > Compute Variable. Type a name (with no spaces) in the Target Variable box (e.g., "cvchisq"). Then type IDF.CHISQ(p, df) into the Numeric Expression box. Here p is the lower-tail area (i.e., one minus the significance level) and df is the degrees of freedom. For example, IDF.CHISQ(0.95, 2) returns the 95th percentile of the chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom (5.991)."

				Since models are 0's and 1's, can do a factorial grid of propensities and map them accordingly from highest to lowest and get demographics?
				
				There would literally be this many combinations based on # of factors, the biggest algorithm I have is 5 factors, so that is 16 distinct probabilities.

		Would have to map logit propensity changes for changes of each variable assuming other variables were held constant.
		Normally assumes the mean for other variables...  I suppose in this case, the median? Should really have all propensities mapped.

	Odds calculation wikipedia
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression
		
		One additional hour of study is estimated to increase log-odds of passing by 1.5046, so multiplying odds of passing by {\displaystyle \exp(1.5046)\approx 4.5.} {\displaystyle \exp(1.5046)\approx 4.5.} The form with the x-intercept (2.71) shows that this estimates even odds (log-odds 0, odds 1, probability 1/2) for a student who studies 2.71 hours.
	
	Oversampling
		Due to bias in class, we did not oversample.  However, we did not build models based on oversampling.  We derived terms from CV models that worked best in randomized datasets.  The system would improve with equalized models, but arguably not by much because we did not use a model based approach.
