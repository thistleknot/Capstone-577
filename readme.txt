Steps
	createdb.bat
		creates database
		
	then run 
		cleandatacode.r

	what it does is two loops.  One changes the seed each pass/iteration of cv over the sample.  The second pass is the base and it resamples from the population (not from a separate training partition, everything get's rescrambled, including holdout).  

	line 237
	#static (outside of monte carlo/resampling, if desire resampling, simply move above set.seed(base))
	line 266
	#monte carlo resample of non holdout!
	
	line 240: 
	NewDF.holdout
	Holdout is always same static regardless of monte carlo resample.
	
	Vars
		widthDivisor
			Sets
				% of sample size in terms of holdout as well as training/validation partitions
				
				Min of 1 seed width
				min of 1 CV width
				
				Default is 3, integer's from 2 to 5 are recommended.
				CV width
				CV passes
				# of models
				Width of loops
		
Hypothesis
		at the 5% sample level using the aggregate data of the subset of the holdout.  We will derive a regression equation there.  Then we will check it against the population and see if it was within range.  If so, we will confirm our hypothesis.  As an addendum, we can derive a population level... this part I think I'd like to ask the professor about.
		
		V7118profile <- c("V7118","V7202","V7551","V8502")   
		eventually reduced to ("V7118, "V7202") (after holdout analysis)

		so... I can derive a regression equation at the holdout analysis juncture, and then see if it holds when I derive a newdataset of the population and derive it's new coefficient terms fitting a model.  See if it's terms fit within the range predicted at the holdout analysis level.  At these junctures, the datasets are aggregated independently (different sampling due to inclusion of different factors, i.e. na drops records based on what columns are included)
		
		Feature extractor will extract features that should display in random samples as significant.
		
		StepAIC
		
		vs CV
		
		different things
		
		V8517 still resulting on 0...

	Milestone 1
		Identified relationships as of commit 3063ef8

	Milestone 2
		Cross validation
		Identified relationships using colsums over a subsample of entire database
		
	Milestone 3
		Implemented Cross Validation and stopped using stepAIC and opted for bestglm which allows for the smallest model to converge based on lowest cv error.  Bestglm has built in CV, which elinates the need for an external loop.
		By aggregating these terms from each subdomain up, we construct a terms list that we feed into a new bestglm formula which spits out a new list.  This list when applied to the population shows extermely significant on all terms.  We tried monte carlo with a manual CV loop but find the cross validation does all the work of comprehensively testing our sample.		

		
	Milestone 4
		Implemented cross validation, monte carlo resampling of sub sample, and resampling of holdout/non holdout data in 2 distinct loops.  I use a width factor that controls all the loops to include # of k folds and cv iterations.  Set to 2 atm.  Default will be 3.		
			
	Milestone 4.2 59eff5e
		
	Milestone 5
		Widthdiviser

	Milestone 6
		In correct formula's, but implementation of 4thpass.

		Major Functions

		Future Direction:
			Exclude >1q
			Problem is... these are limited to 5 in the subset window, would be nice to modify the bestglm.r file to include all the subsets up to k and then filter by those colsums >=median or even >= 3q
			
			Exclude min of best subset on final bout after 3rd pass?

		Milestone 8
			using numRuns >= 50% as bar for inclusion of cv results
			Combing categories of single factors into their own group
			removed a resampling that was redundent ensuring proper holdout was being performed
			
			V7118 and dependent var V8565, in one model it's almost .05 significant, in another it's like .8.  difference being widthSize, perfect example of when a var is significant in one model but not another.  Most likely due to the info is already included in other vars and would be a prime candidate for PCA
				
			incorrect >= 50%...

	Milestone 8.1
	
	219e503
	
		Implemented correct >= 25% as V8517 would not hit this threshold (33% across 4 variables)
		
		Seed appendix for widthSize 1, 2, 3, 5
		
		note widthSize starts excluding at the 25% threshold and excludes the entire v7118 series!
		
		I think it's related to the the holdoutreset loop.  The patterns are being captured on a specific loop, or are present in that % of the population that is captured on that loop.  I'm not overly concerned other than to include it.
		
		reseed bug

Percent formula  
	To get more dispersion, increase holdoutreset loop to say 100 and set resample loop max to 1.  This will be somewhat expensive but will force a reshuffle of the dataset each pass.  As is a CV of 10 simulates this effectively enough without being as expensive.
	
	Imagine the holdout is you shuffle the cards (~reseed & holdout sample) and then 
		take a set of cards away from a deck (macro: holdoutset & nonholdoutset)
		and resample is you take a subsample from this set (micro: pretrain=data.train & holdout=data.text)
		
		Due to this sampling, variations occur during 2a tablization within each holdoutSet's iteration
	
	The ^3 is for reseed, holdout reset, remonte carlo.
	
		Normally, one only needs to do one seed, therefore reducing to ^2	
		
	The +3x is for post evaluation and is used for evaluating the model and if the experiement holds (i.e. always significant population terms), then this part can be viewed as not counted towards the overall cost.
	
	Therefore widthDiviser of 5+ can be accomodated for.  With a max of 10, for ^2 with a 10x10 = 100%, which would result in 100 passes and would obviously monte carlo simulate 100%, but not quite converge.
	
  (x^3)+(3x)
  only the mc set is what costs anything (pre non holdout size) , not the resampling from this set (i.e. pretrain)
  
  the ^3 is the final pruning of the set of factors through a new double wide merged partition set
  then a subsequent one where a fit is derived to confirm significance
  then a 3rd where measures of accuracy are performed  

Cross validation means that if the patterns show up more than half the time (5 out of 10 passes), they are probably truly significant.  I usually have a higher bar, such as the top quartile, or top 10-20%.
	These are not just cross validated against training sets 10 times.  
	To report a positive number.  The significant factors found during the training partition are applied to the validation partition, and what remains as significant are reported.

Note
	V8517
	set preTrain to .25
	
	If sample size is too small and nrFolds value is set too high... will get errors when there is no values in data[-folds], possibly due to na's? mis conversion?

	folds <- rep_len(1:nrFolds, nrow(data))
